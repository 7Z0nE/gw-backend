# What is this branch?

This branch is classified as fail.
It tried to use the Katharsis framework to add JSON API capabilities to the api.
As it turned out, katharsis' documentation was not sufficient and it came with too many limitations for our use case.

However, for the sake of documentation, this branch shall remain here on the graveyard.
